**Abstract:**
This research addresses the urgent concern of Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs) and their association with pedestrian risk in Lagos, Nigeria, utilizing deep learning models InceptionV3 and Data-efficient image Transformer (DeiT) on the novel GSVLagos1 dataset. The study introduces automated pedestrian risk classification, leveraging 1384 Google Street View images, and explores transfer learning techniques. Results reveal comparable performance, with InceptionV3 and DeiT achieving validation accuracies of 69.51% and 68.64%, respectively. The study emphasizes the significance of GSV imagery for urban risk assessment, offering insights for future research and urban planning in developing areas.

**Experiments and Results:**
The research introduces a novel GSVLagos1 dataset, classified into four risk categories based on pedestrian counts. InceptionV3 and DeiT models undergo transfer learning and fine-tuning on this dataset. The study investigates normalization layer modifications, revealing their impact on model performance. The experimental results show comparable performance between InceptionV3 and DeiT, with validation accuracies reaching 69.51% and 68.64%, respectively. The 'invalid' class exhibits the highest accuracy, likely due to its distinctive nature. Challenges in dataset annotation are acknowledged, suggesting the need for dataset scaling to enhance model generalization.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, experiments with InceptionV3 and DeiT on GSVLagos1 dataset indicate comparable performance across pedestrian risk classes. Transformer architectures, exemplified by DeiT, demonstrate effectiveness in computer vision tasks for urban risk assessment. Modification of normalization layers in pretrained convolutional networks is found to be counterproductive. Future work entails dataset expansion, alternative labeling for clarity, and further experiments with emerging architectures to enhance the robustness of the proposed pedestrian risk classification system. The study contributes valuable insights for urban planning, infrastructure development, and traffic safety initiatives in developing urban areas.
